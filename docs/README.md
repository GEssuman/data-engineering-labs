# Real-Time Data Ingestion Using Spark Structured Streaming & PostgreSQL

This project implements a real-time data pipeline that simulates user events on an e-commerce platform, processes the data in real-time using Apache Spark Structured Streaming, and stores the results in a PostgreSQL database.

## Documentation
